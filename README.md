## Welcome to Eglise Vivante Nyarugunga

## Vision 
Proclaiming the good news, forming the disciples and demonstrating the life of Jesus Christ to the world
## Mission 
All this is from God who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation. 2 Corinthians 5:18
They will rebuild the ancient ruins and restore the places long devastated; they will renew the ruined cities that have been devastated for generations. Isaiah 61:4

We spread hope and healing to God’s people by building up relational believers and renewing our communities so that they are equipped holistically in education, in health and spiritual development.

## Core Values
We are hospitality driven people: We purposely create safe spaces for all people including enemies so that they are inclined to become friends.
We understand that every person was created in God’s image and therefore should be treated with dignity.
We embrace and welcome all people to participate with us in the ministry of healing and reconciliation.

We are people of integrity: We are good stewards of our resources including financial, material, talents and relationships before God and people.
Our accountability is before God and the church;
We walk consistently in a healthy intra and interpersonal growth up to maturity as we speak the truth while full of love, watching over our confidentiality and resolving all conflicts biblically.

We are team work oriented: we realized that synergy of teams is a multiplying factor in every ministry and we intentionally work interdependently instead of independently.
We know that unique gifts, experience and talents of team players are more productive when combined rather than separately. We treasure them all. 
We experience unity in our diversity by embracing our vision of Christ centeredness.

We humbly serve our people: We recognize that we completely depend on God for who we are, think, have and achieve.
Our strength comes from God’s presence and power.
Our motives are not from our human plan, need or capacity but from the Spirit of God
We are a teachable and relational people: we do not passively wait for leaders to correct us, but we actively and humbly seek feedback and ways to grow. We therefore stay aware of and take responsibility for the impact we are having on the people around us.
